Authors: Jared Draper, Doug Witt, Nathan Swinger, Christian Leslie

This project focuses on employing various data mining techniques to address a classic binary classification problem: predicting the likelihood of successful package delivery after an initial failed attempt. Through an extensive preprocessing phase, we compare the performance of mining methods including Na√Øve Bayes, CART, Random Forests, and SVM. Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and confusion matrices serve as evaluation metrics to determine the optimal algorithm. The selected algorithm will be potentially utilized to develop an application for predicting package deliverability.
